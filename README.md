## Sandify

Sandify turns your cold, empty-hearted, emotionless sand tables into cold, empty-hearted, emotionless sand table robots with enchanting patterns.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2Fjeffeb3%2Fsandify%2Fbadge&style=for-the-badge)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/jeffeb3/sandify/goto)

Sandify outputs code you can run on your sand table. The code produced is:
 - Continuous, since the ball can't lift to travel to another location.
 - Bounded to never exceed machine limits, as the firmware isn't typically smart enough to handle.

Sandify supports a large number of shape types and effects, so be creative! Input is welcome from the community.

## Using Sandify

 - Head over to [sandify.org]((https://sandify.org).
 - Adjust the machine limits to match your table.
 - Add shapes and effects until you create a pleasing pattern.
 - Export the code in a format supported by your table.
